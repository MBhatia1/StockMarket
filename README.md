# StockMarket
A C++ Project for my EECS 281: Data Structures & Algorithms class which simulates a stock market exchange among traders using priority queues. Data is fed into the program via a text file, which contains a list of stock trades, each line specifying a buyer, seller, stock number, number of stocks sold, and sale price. The program worked by matching buyers and sellers to maximize profit, depending on who made the offering first. The program also supported a time traveler option, in which the buyer was matched with the best potential seller(or vice versa) of the entire day.

Due to restrictions from the honor code at the University of Michigan, I am unable to publish source code at this time. If you are a recruiter who is interested in viewing the source code, please contact me at manavb@umich.edu. I have uploaded sample input files so that you may get an idea of what the problem for this project entailed.
