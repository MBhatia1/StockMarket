# StockMarket
A C++ Project for my EECS 281: Data Structures & Algorithms class which simulates a stock market exchange among traders using priority queues. Data is fed into the program via a text file, which contains a list of stock trades, each line specifying a buyer, seller, stock number, number of stocks sold, and sale price. Traders will buy and sell to maximize their profit, and the outcome for each is displayed in the terminal output.

Due to restrictions from the honor code at the University of Michigan, I am unable to publish source code at this time. If you are a recruiter who is interested in viewing the source code, please contact me at manavb@umich.edu. I have uploaded sample input files so that you may get an idea of what the problem for this project entailed.
